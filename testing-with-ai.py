#AI-enhanced testing tools like Testim.io improve testing coverage through intelligent element locators, visual AI, and auto-maintenance of broken scripts. Unlike manual testing, AI can detect UI changes, adapt scripts, and generate test suggestions based on user interaction patterns. This results in broader test coverage, fewer false positives, and reduced script maintenance. During the login page test, the AI tool helped track element changes and highlighted test instability areas. Overall, AI testing significantly speeds up the QA cycle and reduces human error.
