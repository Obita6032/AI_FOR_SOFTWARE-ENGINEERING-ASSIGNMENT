The AI-suggested version using sorted() is more efficient and Pythonic. It leverages Python's Timsort algorithm, which has an average time complexity of O(n log n). This approach is clean, concise, and easier to maintain. In contrast, the manual implementation simulates insertion sort, which is O(nÂ²) in the worst case, and significantly slower for larger datasets. Furthermore, Copilot suggested the built-in sorted() function with a lambda expression automatically, reducing development time. While manual coding shows an understanding of algorithm design, the AI approach is superior in terms of performance, readability, and developer productivity.
